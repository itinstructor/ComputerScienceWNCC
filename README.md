### Purpose
I am an Information Technology Instructor at Western Nebraska Community College. I teach Information Technology, CyberSecurity and Computer Science.

This repository is for all WNCC Computer Science Courses. We cover Python, Java, and C++.

In the current software development environment, it is good to learn more than one language. Learning the concepts is what is important, not memorizing the syntax. Learning more than one language at a time helps generalize programming concepts.
